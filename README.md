# Food-Dash
## The new food ordering system
<br />
<br />

## About
Our dev's spent a long time inside during lockdown and we realised how hard it is for some people. So we came up with foodDASH. A new way to order food!

## Where's The Mac Edition?
Curently we are working hard on a mac rellease. Since windows is the most used OS we have decided to start with that. Our members have much better knowledge with C and C# than other stuff. (And how can we get this to work with python anyway?)
<br />
We are expanding our Dev team and we hope to get it finished soon ;)

## How Do I Download!
### It's Easy!
Go to https://github.com/Tavex-Bots/Food-Dash/releases/ and download the latest version for your os. Please note this is only for development versions. Full versions will be available at https://fooddash.tavexbots.xyz/ or https://tavexbots.xyz/fooddash/download
